## Personal Note

This was an interesting and challenging demo project. Lacking experience in Uniswap, blockchain, and crypto, I had difficulty interpreting some of the schema's data and the relationships between the data. I implemented tabular and visual data where I saw opportunities that made sense to me.

I use TypeScript in the back-end quite a lot and I've occasionally worked on TS-enhanced React projects. However, I opted to use plain (non-TS) React in this demo because I'm more familiar with it.

I enjoyed getting to know GraphQL better through this project. I had used Apollo previously at Target, but that was a while back and this proved a good refresher.
